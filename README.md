# PlateCollater
A tool for collating .asc data recieved from a 96-well plate reader. Seperates data by time and plate number and saves in a seperate folder in .xlsx format.

Upon prompt, double-click on the directory containing the '.asc' 96-well plate data. After determining the time interval and total plate number the script will output the data within the directory in a folder labelled with the experiment date and a '-O' suffix.
